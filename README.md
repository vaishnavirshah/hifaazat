As the name suggests '***hifaazat***', our application is focused on safety. It is an android application built with flutter and firebase. This application notifies the user's saved contacts or the police in case of any danger.

The aim was to create an app that is easy to use and has all the useful features in one place, unlike other safety applications.
##
The main features which are included are:

  -- Maps
- Shows your current location and the saved locations (if you have any stored)
- Shows the markers for nearby hospitals, train stations, police stations, and many more public places

 -- SOS button
- Calls your first saved contact (or if you does not have any saved, it will call 101)
- At the same time it will send a message to all the saved contacts with your address.

-- Custom Messaging
- Allow the user to send messages to its saved contacts, either using the templates or write a personal message.

-- Scream Button
- A loud noise for alerting nearby people.

-- Shake
- Shake to enable SOS, if this feature is an inconvenience it can also be switched off using a toggle switch.
